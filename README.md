# gene-predictor-hackathon
🧬 Generative Gene Effect Predictor (Hackathon Project)Live Demo: [INSERT YOUR GITHUB PAGES URL HERE]This project demonstrates a novel pipeline for predicting the functional outcome (e.g., HARMFUL, BENEFICIAL) of a genetic modification and generating a concise, scientifically plausible narrative to justify the result using the Gemini API.It integrates structured biological data with a predictive machine learning model to move beyond simple classification and provide rich, contextualized hypotheses.✨ Key Features & Generative AI InnovationData Integration: Merges disparate biological datasets (examples.csv, pathways.csv, kb_passages.csv, species.csv) into a unified feature space.Predictive ML Model: A Logistic Regression pipeline (using TF-IDF for text and One-Hot encoding for categorical data) trained to classify outcomes (Harmful, Beneficial, Other).Generative Narrative (The Innovation): Uses the Gemini API to take the predicted label and the input context (Gene, Modification, Pathway) and generate a 3-sentence scientific hypothesis. This elevates the system from a classifier to a "Hypothesis Assistant."Shared Community Tool: Deployed as a single-file web application using Firestore to share live predictions among team members.⚙️ Architecture and Data FlowThe application consists of three main stages:Data Processing (Offline - Python/Jupyter): CSV files are cleaned, normalized, mapped (Gene $\to$ Pathway), and used to train the Scikit-learn pipeline (gene_effect_predictor_pipeline.joblib).Web App (Online - index.html): The client-side JavaScript simulates the trained ML model's logic based on extracted feature weights (e.g., 'knockout' $\to$ harmful tendency) to quickly get a prediction label.Generative Layer (API Call): The prediction label is passed to the Gemini API alongside the gene's pathway context to synthesize the final explanatory narrative.🚀 Getting StartedThis project is a single-file application for maximum deployability.1. File StructureEnsure you have the following file in your repository root:index.html: The complete, self-contained web application (HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase/Gemini API calls).2. Deployment (GitHub Pages)Push the index.html file to the main branch of this repository.Navigate to Settings $\to$ Pages and select the main branch and the / (root) folder, then click Save.Your site will be live at the URL provided by GitHub Pages.3. Database Configuration (MANDATORY)To enable the "Community Predictions" sharing feature, you must configure the Firestore security rules in your linked Firebase project:Go to Firebase Console $\to$ Firestore Database $\to$ Rules.Paste and Publish the following rules to ensure public read/write access to the prediction history:rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/predictions/{documentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
📈 Next Steps (Future Work)Embeddings: Replace simple TF-IDF with BioBERT or other biological word embeddings to capture more nuanced relationships in the text.Transfer Learning: Use larger, pre-trained models to overcome the small dataset size challenge.Full ML Model Deployment: Implement a serverless function (e.g., Google Cloud Functions) to host the actual Python/Scikit-learn pipeline, replacing the client-side simulation.
